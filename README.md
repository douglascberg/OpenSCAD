Designs in OpenSCAD of 3D printable objects

Being a long time software engineer but new to 3D printing, I find OpenSCAD very usable for mechanical objects.  This project will host
the designs for those things that I will be printing.  It is likely that you will find these same objects in thingiverse as I get them
refined.
